# How to create a release

A release can be created by creating a git tag for a commit. The tag must follow this pattern: 
v1.2 or v1.2.3

I.e.: vX.X.Z where X, Y, Z are the major, minor resp. the patch level of the release. Z can be omitted.

**Note:** Such kind of release tags should only be applied to commits in the master branch.
